# Email Troubleshooting Guide for Optimizi

## üö® Quick Fix Checklist

If supplier notification emails are not being sent, follow these steps in order:

### 1. Check Email Server Status
```bash
cd "supplier (2)/project/server"
npm run debug
```

This will test your email configuration step by step and verify Gmail connectivity.

### 2. Verify Gmail App Password Setup

**CRITICAL**: You MUST use a Gmail App Password, not your regular Gmail password.

#### Steps to create Gmail App Password:
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Factor Authentication** (required for App Passwords)
3. Go to **"App passwords"** section
4. Select **"Mail"** as the app type
5. Copy the 16-character password (format: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
6. **Remove all spaces** when adding to `.env` file

#### Common App Password Issues:
- ‚ùå Using regular Gmail password instead of App Password
- ‚ùå App Password contains spaces
- ‚ùå 2FA not enabled on Gmail account
- ‚ùå Wrong Gmail address

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create/update `supplier (2)/project/server/.env`:

```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
FROM_NAME=Optimizi
PORT=4001
ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED=true
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
- Replace `abcdefghijklmnop` with your actual 16-character App Password (no spaces)

### 4. Test Email Configuration

```bash
cd "supplier (2)/project/server"
npm run test
```

You should receive a test email in your Gmail inbox.

### 5. Start Email Server

```bash
cd "supplier (2)/project/server"
npm run dev
```

Look for these success messages:
```
‚úÖ Gmail SMTP transporter verified and ready
üöÄ Optimizi Email Server running on port 4001
‚úÖ Email service is ACTIVE and ready to send emails
```

### 6. Configure Frontend Environment Variables

**Client Frontend** (`client/project/.env`):
```env
VITE_EMAIL_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4001
```

**Supplier Frontend** (`supplier (2)/project/.env`):
```env
VITE_EMAIL_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4001
VITE_SUPPLIER_SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

### 7. Test End-to-End Email Flow

1. **Start the email server**:
   ```bash
   cd "supplier (2)/project/server"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the supplier frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd "supplier (2)/project"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the notification system**:
   - Navigate to `/email-test` in the supplier dashboard
   - Run configuration and connection tests
   - Send a test email to verify functionality

4. **Test with real orders** (if client is also running):
   ```bash
   cd "client/project"
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Place an order through the client interface
   - Check supplier email for order notification
   - Update order status through supplier interface
   - Verify notifications are sent for status changes

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Authentication failed" Error
**Cause**: Wrong Gmail credentials
**Solution**: 
- Verify Gmail address is correct
- Generate a new App Password
- Ensure 2FA is enabled

### Issue 2: "Connection timeout" Error
**Cause**: Network/firewall issues
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Disable antivirus/firewall temporarily
- Try different SMTP configuration

### Issue 3: Emails not received but no errors
**Cause**: Emails going to spam or wrong address
**Solution**:
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify recipient email addresses
- Check Gmail "Sent" folder to confirm emails are being sent

### Issue 4: "Invalid login" Error
**Cause**: Using regular password instead of App Password
**Solution**:
- Create Gmail App Password
- Use App Password in .env file
- Remove all spaces from App Password

### Issue 5: Server not starting
**Cause**: Missing dependencies or port conflicts
**Solution**:
```bash
cd "supplier (2)/project/server"
npm install
# Try different port if 4001 is busy
PORT=4002 npm run dev
```

### Issue 6: Supplier notifications not working but client emails work
**Cause**: Frontend environment variables not configured
**Solution**:
- Check `supplier (2)/project/.env` file exists
- Verify VITE_EMAIL_BACKEND_URL points to email server
- Restart supplier frontend after .env changes

### Issue 7: HTML emails not displaying correctly
**Cause**: Email client compatibility issues
**Solution**:
- Test with different email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Check spam folder settings
- Verify HTML template syntax in browser first
